## Key Principles

- **Each focus area generates independently** - Don't mix their logic
- **Follow instructions exactly** - Each instructions.md is authoritative
- **Use MCP when specified** - Focus areas can request external data
- **Be concise but thorough** - Briefing should be quick to read
- **Actionable over informational** - Focus on what to DO today

## MCP Integration

Focus areas can specify MCP integrations in their instructions. When generating briefings, use Google Workspace MCP if available:

**Google Calendar** (`mcp_google_workspace_get_events`):
- Fetch today's events: `get_events(user_google_email, calendar_id="primary")`
- Calculate available focus time
- Get meeting details for prep suggestions
- Used by time-blocking for schedule generation

**Gmail** (`mcp_google_workspace_search_gmail_messages`):
- Search recent emails: `search_gmail_messages(query="is:unread", user_google_email)`
- Get message content: `get_gmail_message_content(message_id, user_google_email)`
- Identify high-priority or time-sensitive emails
- Used by email-intelligence focus area (if exists)

**Google Docs** (`mcp_google_workspace_get_doc_content`):
- Read meeting notes or documentation
- Access shared documents
- Get project context

**Google Drive** (`mcp_google_workspace_search_drive_files`):
- Search for relevant files
- Access stored links or documents
- Get file content for context

**Google Sheets** (`mcp_google_workspace_read_sheet_values`):
- Read data from spreadsheets
- Get project tracking info

**Always:**
- Check if MCP is available before calling
- Gracefully degrade if MCP unavailable
- Follow focus area instructions for which MCP services to use

---

## Error Handling

- If focus area's instructions.md is missing: Skip that area, warn user
- If MCP integration fails: Generate briefing without that data, note limitation
- If no focus areas exist: Provide basic briefing (date, calendar if available)
- If focus area's briefing is empty: Skip that section, don't show empty headers

---

## Options (Future)

Could support parameters:
- `/daily-briefing tomorrow` - Briefing for next day
- `/daily-briefing 2025-01-20` - Specific date
- `/daily-briefing week` - Week overview

---

## Notes

- Should be **quick to read** (< 5 minutes)
- Should be **actionable** (clear next steps)
- Focus areas control their own sections
- The more data from daily updates, the better briefings become
