# Daily Logs

This folder contains your daily update logs. Each file is named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

---

## How to Use

1. At the end of each day, type `/daily-update` in Cursor
2. Share what you worked on (free-form, conversational)
3. The AI saves your update here and processes it through all focus areas

---

## What to Include

Just talk naturally about your day:
- What you worked on
- What you accomplished
- Meetings you attended
- People you helped
- Challenges faced
- What you learned
- Observations about work patterns
- Tomorrow's focus

**Don't worry about structure** - the AI will extract what each focus area needs.

## What Happens

When you do `/daily-update`:

1. **AI saves your update** to `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (raw, as you wrote it)
2. **AI processes through each focus area** in `/focus-areas/`
3. **Each focus area** reads its `instructions.md` and extracts what it needs
4. **AI summarizes** what was learned across all focus areas
